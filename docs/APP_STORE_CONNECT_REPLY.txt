Hello App Store Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback. CanIEat does not require login credentials or user accounts.

To test the expired trial flow, please follow these simple steps:

1. Open the CanIEat app (no login required)
2. Tap the "About" tab at the bottom navigation
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page
4. You'll see a section labeled "🧪 App Store Review Test Mode"
5. Tap the "⏰ Expire Trial Now" button
6. Confirm the expiration in the dialog

This will immediately expire the 7-day free trial, allowing you to test the subscription purchase flow.

After expiring the trial:
- Try accessing a premium feature (tap "Get Detailed Analysis" on any food search)
- You'll see the subscription prompt with pricing
- You can test purchasing using Apple's sandbox test accounts

To reset the trial for retesting, simply tap the "🔄 Reset Trial (7 days)" button in the same test mode section.

No test credentials are needed. The test mode controls are built into the app specifically for your review.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best regards,
CanIEat Development Team
